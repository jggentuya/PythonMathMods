## Setting up the Conda Environment and Python Packages
To setup the conda environment in your local machine, do the following:
1. Go to the directory where the `environment.yml` is located.
2. Assuming that you already have an existing anaconda installation, type `conda env create -f environment.yml` and wait for the installation to finish.
3. Now, to install other required python packages, type `pip install -r requirements.txt` and wait for the installation to finish.
